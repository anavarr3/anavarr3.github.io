    <h2>Investigative and Data Journalist</h2> -->
    <p>I'm an investigative and data journalist with experience covering a wide range of topics from climate change, green energy and natural disasters to LGBTQ+ rights, Baltimore City's opioid crisis and crypto's role in the 2024 elections. I am currently a graduate student and Howard Fellow at the University of Maryland, where I am focusing on investigative and data journalism. Before grad school, I worked as a digital journalist at AccuWeather. Since then, I have interened at The Washington Post and The Baltimore Banner at their respective data desks, and my work has been featured in Politico and The Balitmore Sun.
